/*Salaam baby.Thanks for letting know how my questioning does make you feel.Really sorry it's been getting through to you.I only wish you had spoken about it earlier rather than just staying quite.Anyway, that's not to say i ask questions when necessary,especially when i deem them necessary. Believe me I don't like asking them, it's fun when we call each other and just tell ourselves how much in love we are,but at the same time, there's things we have to deal with together, and unfortunately we both need to be on the same page,and that can't happen till we both know what is in each others mind.
I dont know how you get to know what is in my mind,but for me I ask the questions,which will either bring the thing to your awareness or if you had thought of it,tell me and if not,we find solutions.

Salaam baby. Just decided to send a message on this so because our conversations will likely keep getting interrupted. Like I was saying when we spoke, I never used to ask you questions before when you told me you would do something(or atleast not as many). Arent you curious what happened? Arent you curious why I ask those question? Before when you said you'll do something, I assumed you must have asked yourself the basic questions.But over time,it began occuring to me perhaps you dont ask your selve enough of them.
Do you have any idea how much time it would have saved us...if when you had accepted you could run away the first time and I asked you if you arent worried about what will happen to mom or the shame to family? (I had those questions in mind but trusted you must have asked yourselve that and were convinced you could actually do it,but of a sudden it became a huge problem and you can't do it and had to take a few days to think about it. I felt extremely stupid the day you told me you couldnt do it because of so and so reasons, something we both had spoken about and accepted would be done on several occasions).
You dont like me mentioning last time(before you went for the wedding),but how dont you understand where am coming from given last time (Of which i actually remember you telling me you dont like questions and i should not even bring up last time because you wont understand... REALLY??? You dont even care what makes me ask the questions??? Because you dont like it,I should have no reason to ask them???).
Dont get me wrong, but in as much as i try resisting it, sometimes i get pushed to think perhaps your sub conscious mind operates in a mode of,I have two options, staying put where I am or moving forward, and if moving forward fails, its OK, am already here. Which is OK. But understand for me, it is the only option. While i stay put and wait on it, life goes on.While i stay put and wait on it, other options are going as well,other people i could potentially marry wait and go.Besides knowing we are the only people who can get to achieve what we want and we should have acted way back, these are I dont want any waiting in vain anymore.Waiting and not knowing what the end results will be,or atleast doing my best to make sure no stone is left unturn.
From the moment I had these papers ready to submit,if I had submitted them,you will be here right now.But ask me why they weren't submitted and i cant even give you any tangible reason,I dont know if you have one. These things sometimes make it feel like time isnt of essence to you and seems its OK if we keep trying and failing and trying and failing.
I really cant stand another lets forget about us, or it didnt work because of so and so and we should try again. Hence,the reason I asked you the other day if you were certain!!! No more excuses for why it didnt work. If we are going to do this,we have got to get it done to the end.

We have waited for three years(this was not necessary).We didnt need 3 years to figure out what we want to do. A year or year and half was sufficient. We are starting another wait for a couple of months,each and everyday that passes is really difficult for me. Planning ahead of time doesnt always mean success,but chances of having success are greatly increased.Also like the saying goes, two minds are better than one. So even if you already had everything planned, i might still be able to contribute in one way or the other (If i were asked,I would have sincerely thought my asking questions,you were going to interprete that as me being passionate about what we are doing and making sure all goes well).

I get concerned when i ask what happens if you are followed and the response is you dont think you will be followed.It just generate a bunch of other...crap,what else hasnt she thought about.There's nothing scaring me right now again than waiting a day more and tomorrow getting to be like it didnt work.Just so done waiting and don't wanna do it in vain anymore.We need to get this done to the end.I want you to be certain you wont pull back again because of mom or whatever reason. Am not saying you shouldnt be concerned about her,but just saying think of all possibilities, make up your mind and stick to it.I could understand first time,second time because i so badly want to be with you,third time i dont really know why,but honestly we wait again and nothing, I might find it impossible forgiving you.I never want to think of this,nor do I want to ever get there. Making it also one of the main reasons I dont want to leave any stone unturned.One of the reasons i keep pushing to make sure nothing is missed and we dont leave a thing to chance or perhaps and avoidable situation steps in the way simply because we never planned.

I have hated my life, or atleast my life style, for the past two or so years and absolutely have got to change it.
